For this website we use (HyperText Markup Language)HTML.
You can use whatver IDE you wish.
Personally, I am using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022.
## Some things about HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
We use HTML5
It is preferred if you keep tags lowercase so...
```
<p>HTML5 is the best HTML version</p>
```
Instead of 
```
<P>HTML5 is the best HTML version</P>
```
It is also preferred if you could start your PHP document (if it contains HTML) with...
```
<!DOCTYPE> html
```
Instead of...
```
<!doctype> html
```
